# Security

Microsoft takes the security of our software products and services seriously,
which includes all source code repositories managed through our GitHub
organizations, which include [Microsoft][github-microsoft],
[Azure][github-azure], [DotNet][github-dot-net], [AspNet][github-asp-net],
[Xamarin][github-xamarin],
and [our GitHub organizations][microsoft-open-source].

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Microsoft-owned
repository that meets
[Microsoft's definition of a security vulnerability][vulnerability-definition],
please report it to us as described below.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) at
[msrc.microsoft.com/create-report][msrc-create-report].

If you prefer to submit without logging in, send email to
[secure@microsoft.com][secure-microsoft-email]. If possible, encrypt your
message with our PGP key; please download it from the
[Microsoft Security Response Center PGP Key page][microsoft-pgp-key].

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not,
please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.
Additional information can be found at [microsoft.com/msrc][microsoft-msrc].

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can
provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible
issue:

* Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting,
  etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

If you are reporting for a bug bounty, more complete reports can contribute to a
higher bounty award. Please visit our
[Microsoft Bug Bounty Program][microsoft-bug-bounty] page for more details about
our active programs.
