# Get Involved

## Provide feedback

Please [report an issue on GitHub][github-issue] if you find something to
improve. For example:

* Spoor crashes or you encounter a bug.
* The documentation is incomplete or unclear.
* An error message could be improved.

### Security

Please do _not_ report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.
Instead, report them to the Microsoft Security Response Center at
[msrc.microsoft.com/create-report][msrc-create-report].

## Contribute code

All development happens on [GitHub][github]. Both core team members and external
contributors submit [pull requests][github-pr] which go through the same review
process.

The most helpful contributions fix bugs, improve performance, or add features
(as opposed to stylistic or "gardening" changes). Test and document your work.

When you're read to roll up your sleeves and start coding, see
[Getting Started][getting-started].

### Style guide

Follow Spoor's [style guide][style-guide] when writing code.

### Contributor License Agreement

Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to
use your contribution. For details, visit
[cla.opensource.microsoft.com][microsoft-cla].

When you submit a pull request, the CLA bot will automatically determine whether
you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check,
comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need
to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

[Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct]. For more information
