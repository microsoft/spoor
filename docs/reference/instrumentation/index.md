# Instrumentation

## Introduction

Spoor automatically injects instrumentation to log each function's entry and
exit. This allows you to reconstruct your application's runtime stack.

### Supported languages

Spoor's instrumentation works with LLVM-based languages such as `C`, `C++`, and
`Objective-C`, `Rust`, `Swift`, `Kotlin`, `Scala`, and [more][llvm-languages].

## Demo

Check out the [Fibonacci tutorial][fibonacci-tutorial] to see Spoor's
instrumentation in action.

## Packaging

Spoor's instrumentation is available in three flavors.

### LLVM `opt` plugin

```
opt source.ll \
  -load-pass-plugin=libspoor_instrumentation.so \
  -passes="inject-spoor-instrumentation" \
  -S \
  -o source_instrumented.ll
```

### Standalone executable

```
spoor_opt --help
```

```
spoor_opt: Transform LLVM Bitcode/IR by injecting Spoor instrumentation.

USAGE: spoor_opt [options...] [input_file]

EXAMPLES
$ spoor_opt source.bc --output_file=instrumented_source.bc
$ clang++ source.cc -c -emit-llvm -o - | spoor_opt | clang++ -x ir - -lspoor_runtime

Reads from stdin if an input file is not provided.
Prints to stdout if an output file is not provided.

  Flags from spoor/instrumentation/config/command_line.cc:
    --enable_runtime (Automatically enable Spoor's runtime.); default: true;
    --filters_file (File path to the filters file.); default: none;
    --force_binary_output (Force printing binary data to the console.);
      default: false;
    --initialize_runtime (Automatically initialize Spoor's runtime.);
      default: true;
    --inject_instrumentation (Inject Spoor instrumentation.); default: true;
    --module_id (Override the LLVM module's ID.); default: none;
    --output_file (Output file.); default: "-";
    --output_language (Language in which to output the transformed code.
      Options: bitcode, ir.); default: bitcode;
    --output_symbols_file (Spoor instrumentation symbols output file.);
      default: "";

Try --helpfull to get a list of all flags or --help=substring shows help for
flags which include specified substring in either in the name, or description or
path.
```

### Xcode toolchain

Spoor provides `clang` and `swift` wrappers in an `.xctoolchain` to conveniently
integrate with Xcode and build with instrumentation on Apple platforms.

See [get started with Spoor's Xcode toolchain][get-started-xcode-toolchain] for
its installation and usage.

## Automatic injection

Spoor instruments your source code by running a custom out-of-tree optimization
pass over your source codeâ€™s LLVM intermediate representation. By default, it
logs the [funciton ID][function-id] of each function it enters and exists
alongside the events' timestamp. Function IDs are mapped back to the original
function's properties in an emitted [symbols file][symbols].

```diff
  define i64 @Add(i64, i64) {
+   call void @_spoor_runtime_LogFunctionEntry(...)
    %2 = add i64 %0, %1
+   call void @_spoor_runtime_LogFunctionExit(...)
    ret i64 %2
  }
```

Additionally, by default, the instrumentation inserts calls to initialize the
runtime at the start of the main function and an API call to deinitialize the
runtime before each return statement in the main function.

```diff
  define i32 main() {
+   call void @_spoor_runtime_Initialize()
+   call void @_spoor_runtime_Enable()
+   call void @_spoor_runtime_LogFunctionEntry(...)
+   call void @_spoor_runtime_LogFunctionEntry(...)
    %1 = call i32 @Add(1, 2)
+   call void @_spoor_runtime_LogFunctionExit(...)
+   call void @_spoor_runtime_Deinitialize()
    ret i32 %1
  }
```

This behavior is [configurable][configuration].

### Function IDs

Each function is represented by a unique, unsigned 64-bit integer. This value is
logged by `LogFunctionEntry` and `LogFunctionExit`.

Function IDs should be treated as opaque values that are globally unique.

!!! info "Implementation"
    Function IDs are composed of a module ID spanning the most significant 32
    bits and a local function ID spanning the remaining (least significant) 32
    bits. The module ID is a [CityHash][city-hash] hash of the module's LLVM
    instructions making it (very likely to be) be globally unique. Within each
    module, each function is sequentially assigned a local function ID starting
    from 0. 

    **Example function ID**

    ```
     0x89ABCDEF00000001
       |------||------|
     Module ID  Local function ID
    ```

    Note: The implementation is subject to change and is not a value on which
    one should rely or assume to be stable between Spoor versions.


## Symbols

Function IDs are mapped back to the original function's information in an
emitted symbols file. This information includes the function's name, source
file, line number, etc.

The `.spoor_symbols` file is a binary Protocol Buffer that conforms to the
following schema:

[spoor/instrumentation/symbols/symbols.proto][symbols-proto]

Inspect the symbols file and symbolize traces using Spoor's
[postprocessing tools][postprocessing].

## Configuration

Spoor's automatic instrumentation inject behavior is configurable. You can
choose which functions get instrumented and if the runtime is automatically
initialized and enabled.

See Spoor's [instrumentation configuration][instrumentation-configuration] page
for details.

### Function filtering

[Function filtering][configuration-filters] is an important optimization
strategy. Spoor instruments every function by default, however, logging less
improves your application's runtime performance, reduces the amount of memory
that Spoor's runtime must consume to buffer the events, and speeds up Spoor's
postprocessing tools.

Although each application benefits from a unique set of filters tailored to its
use and environment, there are a few general strategies to consider when
deciding what to filter.

**Privacy**

Filter functions that could log sensitive information. For example, if you're
implementing a keyboard and have button handlers `didTapA()`, `didTapB()`,
`didTapC()`, etc., without filtering these functions you're using Spoor as a
key logger!

**Relevance**

Instrument the code that you plan to optimize. For example, it might be
interesting to know when your application makes a library call but not the
library's implementation, especially if its implementation is noisy.

**Function size**

Most functions are very small -- just tens of IR instructions in size. It is
often reasonable to apply a heuristic that functions with few instructions are
fast (but might call larger and more expensive functions). Additionally, the
cost of logging the function's entry and exit might exceed the cost of the
function's logic itself. Thus, filtering these small function calls saves a
significant amount of runtime overhead while still logging the larger and more
"interesting" functions.

50% of functions in Wikipedia's iOS app are less than 15 IR instructions and 95%
are at most 140 IR instructions. Internal experiments show that this
distribution is roughly representative of other programs.
